          <p>My business needed an online store, at the first meeting Eliran was very attentive and gave me support
            and tips and at the same time built a small sketch that showed me how the site should work and
            look.Throughout the process was very attentive to the changes I requested and made them immediately.Even
            after the site went live, Eliran provided technical support and made sure to train some of the employees
            who would be responsible for entering data and uploading products.Thank you very much Eliran!</p>
